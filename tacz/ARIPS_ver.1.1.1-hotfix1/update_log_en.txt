PS:
Unfortunately, the tandem flip sights (like EOTech HHS) and first focal plane scope (like Vortex Razor) still cannot be satisfied by the mechanism provided by TaCZ. Because the attachments do not yet support animation, and other oculars will also be rendered in any aiming view, causing occlusion and unexpected visual effects.
